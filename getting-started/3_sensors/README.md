# Sensors

The PiCar-X has an ultrasonic sensor and a grayscale sensor.

The ultrasonic sensor detects distance and the grayscale sensor can detect black, white, and shades of gray.

Starting with the code examples in the [Ezblock](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/ezblock/play_with_ezblock.html) and [Python](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/play_with_python.html), you can use their sensor code to understand how you can program the car to use the sensors.

## Starting With Examples

A great way to learn how to program the PiCar-X to use the ultrasonic sensor is to start with [the `obstacle avoidance` example](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/python_avoid.html). 

A great way to learn how to program the PiCar-X to use the grayscale sensor is to start with [the `line tracking` example](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/python_line_track.html). 

Read the code to understand how it works. Then run it!

To help you get started and to inspire you to create your own scripts for the car, this project folder contains additional code examples for programming the PiCar-X to drive in various shapes or patterns.

When reading and writing the code, think about the interaction of the sensor data with what the motors and servers are doing. Also consider what limitations the sensors have, like how far and wide the ultrasonic sensors can detect signals and the sensitivity of the grayscale sensor.
