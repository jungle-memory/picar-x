Programming the PiCar-X to drive is really fun.

The example code for [Ezblock](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/ezblock/play_with_ezblock.html) and [Python](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/play_with_python.html) comes with some that make the car drive.

Star with the `move` example.

Here is a video showing it.
