# Sensors

The PiCar-X has an ultrasonic sensor and a grayscale sensor.

The ultrasonic sensor detects distance and the grayscale sensor can detect black, white, and shades of gray.

Starting with the code examples in the [Ezblock](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/ezblock/play_with_ezblock.html) and [Python](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/play_with_python.html), you can use their code that makes the car drive to understand how you can program the car to drive.

## Starting With Examples

A great way to learn how to program the PiCar-X to move is to start with [the `move` example](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/python_move.html). 

Read the code to understand how it works. Then run it!

To help you get started and to inspire you to create your own scripts for the car, this project folder contains additional code examples for programming the PiCar-X to drive in various shapes or patterns.

When reading and writing the code, think about the interaction of the sensor data with what the motors and servers are doing. Also consider what limitations the sensor has, like how far and wide it can detect signals.

Feel free to use and modify the code below.
