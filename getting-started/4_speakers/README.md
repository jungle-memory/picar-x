# Speakers

The PiCar-X has speakers. 

It can talk, play music, and make noises!

Starting with the code examples in the [Ezblock](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/ezblock/play_with_ezblock.html) and [Python](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/play_with_python.html), you can use their code that makes the car talk to understand how you can program the car to make the sounds you want it to.

## Starting With Examples

A great way to learn how to program the PiCar-X to move is to start with [the `text to speech` example](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/python_tts.html). 

Read the code to understand how it works. Then run it!

To help you get started and to inspire you to create your own scripts for the car, this project folder contains additional code examples for programming the PiCar-X to make sounds.

When reading and writing the code, think about other sounds the car could make and how you would implement it.

Feel free to use and modify the code below.
