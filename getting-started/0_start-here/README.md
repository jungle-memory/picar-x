# Start Here

One of the things that makes the PiCar-X so extraordinary is that the setup is as fun and educational as working with the finished product. Sunfounder has made it really easy to follow their instructions and get started. 

Below you will find a roadmap to getting started with their instructions and a few tips from us based on our experience. 

## Get Car

Sunfounder sells the [PiCar-X AI Car kit](https://amzn.to/3uKSQp1) on Amazon. The kit comes with everything you need except the Raspberry Pi, batteries, and battery charger. It comes with all the parts for the car and even a few spare parts. Plus, the kit has a screw driver and allen wrench.

## Get Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is the brains of the car and is sold separately. You can buy them on Amazon too. Look for Rasperry Pi 4 starter kits, like [this one](https://amzn.to/3L1feA7) and [this one](https://amzn.to/3jP7NQL).

These kits come with the essentials you need to work with the car. Specifically, a Raspberry Pi 4 with Wifi and an SD card. They also come with a charging cord and case. Although you will not need the power cord and case for the car, they are good to have.
